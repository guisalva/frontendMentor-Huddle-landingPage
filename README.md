# My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### What I learned

With this project I've tested the most of my knowledge in HTML and CSS, in eye sight it is a simple project but when we start coding the dificulties appears, but I am happy with the result, I've learned a lot of new CSS things, and I have a lot more to learn.

This is one of the CSS property that I've learning during the project that I'm most proud :
```css
.nft-card .image-link::before {
}
```
The uses of the pseudo-classes "before" and "after" are calling my attention rsrs.
